# SGE-Replication
SGE-Replication is a forward-only PyTorch implementation of the Spatial Group-wise Enhance (SGE) module, replicating the feature grouping and spatial attention mechanism from the original paper. It allows visualization of enhanced semantic feature maps and activation statistics without any training.
